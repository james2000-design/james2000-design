    	The key phrase is that, in situations involving a hypergeometric random variable, the selection
is made without replacement, which indeed is what happens frequently in practice. The binomial
distribution can be an extremely useful and easy to use approximation, when the size of the selection
is small compared to the size of the population from which the selection is made. However, it
