This book was written for an introductory one-semester or two-quarter course
in probability and statistics for students in engineering and applied sciences. No
previous knowledge of probability or statistics is presumed but a good understanding
of calculus is a prerequisite for the material.
The development of this book was guided by a number of considerations
observed over many years of teaching courses in this subject area, including the
following: .As an introductory course, a sound and rigorous treatment of the basic
principles is imperative for a proper understanding of the subject matter
and for confidence in applying these principles to practical problem solving.
A student, depending upon his or her major field of study, will no doubt
pursue advanced work in this area in one or more of the many possible
directions. How well is he or she prepared to do this strongly depends on
his or . her mastery of the fundamentals. It is important that the student develop an early appreciation for applications.
Demonstrations of the utility of this material in nonsuperficial applications
not only sustain student interest but also provide the student with
.stimulation to delve more deeply into the fundamentals. Most of the students in engineering and applied sciences can only devote one
semester or two quarters to a course of this nature in their programs.
Recognizing that the coverage is time limited, it is important that the material
be self-contained, representing a reasonably complete and applicable body of
knowledge.
The choice of the contents for this book is in line with the foregoing
observations. The major objective is to give a careful presentation of the
fundamentals in probability and statistics, the concept of probabilistic modeling,
and the process of model selection, verification, and analysis. In this text,
definitions and theorems are carefully stated and topics rigorously treated
but care is taken not to become entangled in excessive mathematical details.
TLFeBOOK
Practical examples are emphasized; they are purposely selected from many
different fields and not slanted toward any particular applied area. The same
objective is observed in making up the exercises at the back of each chapter.
Because of the self-imposed criterion of writing a comprehensive text and
presenting it within a limited time frame, there is a tight continuity from one
topic to the next. Some flexibility exists in Chapters 6 and 7 that include
discussions on more specialized distributions used in practice. For example,
extreme-value distributions may be bypassed, if it is deemed necessary, without
serious loss of continuity. Also, Chapter 11 on linear models may be deferred to
a follow-up course if time does not allow its full coverage.
It is a pleasure to acknowledge the substantial help I received from students
in my courses over many years and from my colleagues and friends. Their
constructive comments on preliminary versions of this book led to many
improvements. My sincere thanks go to Mrs. Carmella Gosden, who efficiently
typed several drafts of this book. As in all my undertakings, my wife, Dottie,
cared about this project and gave me her loving support for which I am deeply
grateful.

Introduction
At present, almost all undergraduate curricula in engineering and applied
sciences contain at least one basic course in probability and statistical inference.
The recognition of this need for introducing the ideas of probability theory in
a wide variety of scientific fields today reflects in part some of the profound
changes in science and engineering education over the past 25 years.
One of the most significant is the greater emphasis that has been placed upon
complexity and precision. A scientist now recognizes the importance of studying
scientific phenomena having complex interrelations among their components;
these components are often not only mechanical or electrical parts but
also ‘soft-science’ in nature, such as those stemming from behavioral and social
sciences. The design of a comprehensive transportation system, for example,
requires a good understanding of technological aspects of the problem as well
as of the behavior patterns of the user, land-use regulations, environmental
requirements, pricing policies, and so on.
Moreover, precision is stressed – precision in describing interrelationships
among factors involved in a scientific phenomenon and precision in predicting
its behavior. This, coupled with increasing complexity in the problems we face,
leads to the recognition that a great deal of uncertainty and variability are
inevitably present in problem formulation, and one of the mathematical tools
that is effective in dealing with them is probability and statistics.
Probabilistic ideas are used in a wide variety of scientific investigations
involving randomness. Randomness is an empirical phenomenon characterized
by the property that the quantities in which we are interested do not have
a predictable outcome under a given set of circumstances, but instead there is
a statistical regularity associated with different possible outcomes. Loosely
speaking, statistical regularity means that, in observing outcomes of an experiment
a large number of times (say n), the ratio m/n, where m is the number of
observed occurrences of a specific outcome, tends to a unique limit as n
becomes large. For example, the outcome of flipping a coin is not predictable
but there is statistical regularity in that the ratio m/n approaches 1
2 for either

heads or tails. Random phenomena in scientific areas abound: noise in radio
signals, intensity of wind gusts, mechanical vibration due to atmospheric disturbances,
Brownian motion of particles in a liquid, number of telephone calls
made by a given population, length of queues at a ticket counter, choice of
transportation modes by a group of individuals, and countless others. It is not
inaccurate to say that randomness is present in any realistic conceptual model
of a real-world phenomenon.
1.1 ORGANIZATION OF TEXT
This book is concerned with the development of basic principles in constructing
probability models and the subsequent analysis of these models. As in other
scientific modeling procedures, the basic cycle of this undertaking consists of
a number of fundamental steps; these are schematically presented in Figure 1.1.
A basic understanding of probability theory and random variables is central to
the whole modeling process as they provide the required mathematical machinery
with which the modeling process is carried out and consequences deduced.
The step from B to C in Figure 1.1 is the induction step by which the structure
of the model is formed from factual observations of the scientific phenomenon
under study. Model verification and parameter estimation (E) on the basis of
observed data (D) fall within the framework of statistical inference. A model

may be rejected at this stage as a result of inadequate inductive reasoning or
insufficient or deficient data. A reexamination of factual observations or additional
data may be required here. Finally, model analysis and deduction are
made to yield desired answers upon model substantiation.
In line with this outline of the basic steps, the book is divided into two parts.
Part A (Chapters 2–7) addresses probability fundamentals involved in steps
A ! C, B ! C, and E ! F (Figure 1.1). Chapters 2–5 provide these fundamentals,
which constitute the foundation of all subsequent development. Some
important probability distributions are introduced in Chapters 6 and 7. The
nature and applications of these distributions are discussed. An understanding
of the situations in which these distributions arise enables us to choose an
appropriate distribution, or model, for a scientific phenomenon.
Part B (Chapters 8–11) is concerned principally with step D ! E (Figure 1.1),
the statistical inference portion of the text. Starting with data and data representation
in Chapter 8, parameter estimation techniques are carefully developed
in Chapter 9, followed by a detailed discussion in Chapter 10 of a number of
selected statistical tests that are useful for the purpose of model verification. In
Chapter 11, the tools developed in Chapters 9 and 10 for parameter estimation
and model verification are applied to the study of linear regression models, a very
useful class of models encountered in science and engineering.
The topics covered in Part B are somewhat selective, but much of the
foundation in statistical inference is laid. This foundation should help the
reader to pursue further studies in related and more advanced areas.
1.2 PROBABILITY TABLES AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE
The application of the materials in this book to practical problems will require
calculations of various probabilities and statistical functions, which can be time
consuming. To facilitate these calculations, some of the probability tables are
provided in Appendix A. It should be pointed out, however, that a large
number of computer software packages and spreadsheets are now available
that provide this information as well as perform a host of other statistical
calculations. As an example, some statistical functions available in Microsoft
ExcelTM 2000 are listed in Appendix B.
1.3 PREREQUISITES
The material presented in this book is calculus-based. The mathematical prerequisite
for a course using this book is a good understanding of differential
and integral calculus, including partial differentiation and multidimensional
integrals. Familiarity in linear algebra, vectors, and matrices is also required.

Basic Probability Concepts
The mathematical theory of probability gives us the basic tools for constructing
and analyzing mathematical models for random phenomena. In studying a
random phenomenon, we are dealing with an experiment of which the outcome
is not predictable in advance. Experiments of this type that immediately come
to mind are those arising in games of chance. In fact, the earliest development
of probability theory in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was motivated by
problems of this type (for example, see Todhunter, 1949).
In science and engineering, random phenomena describe a wide variety of
situations. By and large, they can be grouped into two broad classes. The first
class deals with physical or natural phenomena involving uncertainties. Uncertainty
enters into problem formulation through complexity, through our lack
of understanding of all the causes and effects, and through lack of information.
Consider, for example, weather prediction. Information obtained from satellite
tracking and other meteorological information simply is not sufficient to permit
a reliable prediction of what weather condition will prevail in days ahead. It is
therefore easily understandable that weather reports on radio and television are
made in probabilistic terms.
The second class of problems widely studied by means of probabilistic
models concerns those exhibiting variability. Consider, for example, a problem
in traffic flow where an engineer wishes to know the number of vehicles crossing
a certain point on a road within a specified interval of time. This number
varies unpredictably from one interval to another, and this variability reflects
variable driver behavior and is inherent in the problem. This property forces us
to adopt a probabilistic point of view, and probability theory provides a
powerful tool for analyzing problems of this type.
It is safe to say that uncertainty and variability are present in our modeling of
all real phenomena, and it is only natural to see that probabilistic modeling and
analysis occupy a central place in the study of a wide variety of topics in science
and engineering. There is no doubt that we will see an increasing reliance on the
use of probabilistic formulations in most scientific disciplines in the future.

2.1 ELEMENTS OF SET THEORY
Our interest in the study of a random phenomenon is in the statements we can
make concerning the events that can occur. Events and combinations of events
thus play a central role in probability theory. The mathematics of events is
closely tied to the theory of sets, and we give in this section some of its basic
concepts and algebraic operations.
A set is a collection of objects possessing some common properties. These
objects are called elements of the set and they can be of any kind with any
specified properties. We may consider, for example, a set of numbers, a set of
mathematical functions, a set of persons, or a set of a mixture of things. Capital
letters , , , , , . . . shall be used to denote sets, and lower-case letters
, , , , . . . to denote their elements. A set is thus described by its elements.
Notationally, we can write, for example,
which means that set has as its elements integers 1 through 6. If set contains
two elements, success and failure, it can be described by
where and are chosen to represent success and failure, respectively. For a set
consisting of all nonnegative real numbers, a convenient description is
We shall use the convention
to mean ‘element belongs to set ’.
A set containing no elements is called an empty or null set and is denoted by .
We distinguish between sets containing a finite number of elements and those
having an infinite number. They are called, respectively, finite sets and infinite
sets. An infinite set is called enumerable or countable if all of its elements can be
arranged in such a way that there is a one-to-one correspondence between them
and all positive integers; thus, a set containing all positive integers 1, 2, . . . is a
simple example of an enumerable set. A nonenumerable or uncountable set is one
where the above-mentioned one-to-one correspondence cannot be established. A
simple example of a nonenumerable set is the set C described above.
If every element of a set A is also an element of a set B, the set A is called
a subset of B and this is represented symbolically by

and A is the shaded area. We note here that the following relations clearly hold:

The development of this book was guided by a number of considerations
observed over many years of teaching courses in this subject area, including the
following: .As an introductory course, a sound and rigorous treatment of the basic
principles is imperative for a proper understanding of the subject matter
and for confidence in applying these principles to practical problem solving.
A student, depending upon his or her major field of study, will no doubt
pursue advanced work in this area in one or more of the many possible
directions. How well is he or she prepared to do this strongly depends on
his or . her mastery of the fundamentals. It is important that the student develop an early appreciation for applications.
Demonstrations of the utility of this material in nonsuperficial applications
not only sustain student interest but also provide the student with
.stimulation to delve more deeply into the fundamentals. Most of the students in engineering and applied sciences can only devote one
semester or two quarters to a course of this nature in their programs.
Recognizing that the coverage is time limited, it is important that the material
be self-contained, representing a reasonably complete and applicable body of
knowledge.
The choice of the contents for this book is in line with the foregoing
observations. The major objective is to give a careful presentation of the
fundamentals in probability and statistics, the concept of probabilistic modeling,
and the process of model selection, verification, and analysis. In this text,
definitions and theorems are carefully stated and topics rigorously treated
but care is taken not to become entangled in excessive mathematical details.

Practical examples are emphasized; they are purposely selected from many
different fields and not slanted toward any particular applied area. The same
objective is observed in making up the exercises at the back of each chapter.
Because of the self-imposed criterion of writing a comprehensive text and
presenting it within a limited time frame, there is a tight continuity from one
topic to the next. Some flexibility exists in Chapters 6 and 7 that include
discussions on more specialized distributions used in practice. For example,
extreme-value distributions may be bypassed, if it is deemed necessary, without
serious loss of continuity. Also, Chapter 11 on linear models may be deferred to
a follow-up course if time does not allow its full coverage.
It is a pleasure to acknowledge the substantial help I received from students
in my courses over many years and from my colleagues and friends. Their
constructive comments on preliminary versions of this book led to many
improvements. My sincere thanks go to Mrs. Carmella Gosden, who efficiently
typed several drafts of this book. As in all my undertakings, my wife, Dottie,
cared about this project and gave me her loving support for which I am deeply
grateful.

Introduction
At present, almost all undergraduate curricula in engineering and applied
sciences contain at least one basic course in probability and statistical inference.
The recognition of this need for introducing the ideas of probability theory in
a wide variety of scientific fields today reflects in part some of the profound
changes in science and engineering education over the past 25 years.
One of the most significant is the greater emphasis that has been placed upon
complexity and precision. A scientist now recognizes the importance of studying
scientific phenomena having complex interrelations among their components;
these components are often not only mechanical or electrical parts but
also ‘soft-science’ in nature, such as those stemming from behavioral and social
sciences. The design of a comprehensive transportation system, for example,
requires a good understanding of technological aspects of the problem as well
as of the behavior patterns of the user, land-use regulations, environmental
requirements, pricing policies, and so on.
Moreover, precision is stressed – precision in describing interrelationships
among factors involved in a scientific phenomenon and precision in predicting
its behavior. This, coupled with increasing complexity in the problems we face,
leads to the recognition that a great deal of uncertainty and variability are
inevitably present in problem formulation, and one of the mathematical tools
that is effective in dealing with them is probability and statistics.
Probabilistic ideas are used in a wide variety of scientific investigations
involving randomness. Randomness is an empirical phenomenon characterized
by the property that the quantities in which we are interested do not have
a predictable outcome under a given set of circumstances, but instead there is
a statistical regularity associated with different possible outcomes. Loosely
speaking, statistical regularity means that, in observing outcomes of an experiment
a large number of times (say n), the ratio m/n, where m is the number of
observed occurrences of a specific outcome, tends to a unique limit as n
becomes large. For example, the outcome of flipping a coin is not predictable
but there is statistical regularity in that the ratio m/n approaches 1
2 for either

heads or tails. Random phenomena in scientific areas abound: noise in radio
signals, intensity of wind gusts, mechanical vibration due to atmospheric disturbances,
Brownian motion of particles in a liquid, number of telephone calls
made by a given population, length of queues at a ticket counter, choice of
transportation modes by a group of individuals, and countless others. It is not
inaccurate to say that randomness is present in any realistic conceptual model
of a real-world phenomenon.
1.1 ORGANIZATION OF TEXT
This book is concerned with the development of basic principles in constructing
probability models and the subsequent analysis of these models. As in other
scientific modeling procedures, the basic cycle of this undertaking consists of
a number of fundamental steps; these are schematically presented in Figure 1.1.
A basic understanding of probability theory and random variables is central to
the whole modeling process as they provide the required mathematical machinery
with which the modeling process is carried out and consequences deduced.
The step from B to C in Figure 1.1 is the induction step by which the structure
of the model is formed from factual observations of the scientific phenomenon
under study. Model verification and parameter estimation (E) on the basis of
observed data (D) fall within the framework of statistical inference. A model

may be rejected at this stage as a result of inadequate inductive reasoning or
insufficient or deficient data. A reexamination of factual observations or additional
data may be required here. Finally, model analysis and deduction are
made to yield desired answers upon model substantiation.
In line with this outline of the basic steps, the book is divided into two parts.
Part A (Chapters 2–7) addresses probability fundamentals involved in steps
A ! C, B ! C, and E ! F (Figure 1.1). Chapters 2–5 provide these fundamentals,
which constitute the foundation of all subsequent development. Some
important probability distributions are introduced in Chapters 6 and 7. The
nature and applications of these distributions are discussed. An understanding
of the situations in which these distributions arise enables us to choose an
appropriate distribution, or model, for a scientific phenomenon.
Part B (Chapters 8–11) is concerned principally with step D ! E (Figure 1.1),
the statistical inference portion of the text. Starting with data and data representation
in Chapter 8, parameter estimation techniques are carefully developed
in Chapter 9, followed by a detailed discussion in Chapter 10 of a number of
selected statistical tests that are useful for the purpose of model verification. In
Chapter 11, the tools developed in Chapters 9 and 10 for parameter estimation
and model verification are applied to the study of linear regression models, a very
useful class of models encountered in science and engineering.
The topics covered in Part B are somewhat selective, but much of the
foundation in statistical inference is laid. This foundation should help the
reader to pursue further studies in related and more advanced areas.
1.2 PROBABILITY TABLES AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE
The application of the materials in this book to practical problems will require
calculations of various probabilities and statistical functions, which can be time
consuming. To facilitate these calculations, some of the probability tables are
provided in Appendix A. It should be pointed out, however, that a large
number of computer software packages and spreadsheets are now available
that provide this information as well as perform a host of other statistical
calculations. As an example, some statistical functions available in Microsoft
ExcelTM 2000 are listed in Appendix B.
1.3 PREREQUISITES
The material presented in this book is calculus-based. The mathematical prerequisite
for a course using this book is a good understanding of differential
and integral calculus, including partial differentiation and multidimensional
integrals. Familiarity in linear algebra, vectors, and matrices is also required.

Basic Probability Concepts
The mathematical theory of probability gives us the basic tools for constructing
and analyzing mathematical models for random phenomena. In studying a
random phenomenon, we are dealing with an experiment of which the outcome
is not predictable in advance. Experiments of this type that immediately come
to mind are those arising in games of chance. In fact, the earliest development
of probability theory in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was motivated by
problems of this type (for example, see Todhunter, 1949).
In science and engineering, random phenomena describe a wide variety of
situations. By and large, they can be grouped into two broad classes. The first
class deals with physical or natural phenomena involving uncertainties. Uncertainty
enters into problem formulation through complexity, through our lack
of understanding of all the causes and effects, and through lack of information.
Consider, for example, weather prediction. Information obtained from satellite
tracking and other meteorological information simply is not sufficient to permit
a reliable prediction of what weather condition will prevail in days ahead. It is
therefore easily understandable that weather reports on radio and television are
made in probabilistic terms.
The second class of problems widely studied by means of probabilistic
models concerns those exhibiting variability. Consider, for example, a problem
in traffic flow where an engineer wishes to know the number of vehicles crossing
a certain point on a road within a specified interval of time. This number
varies unpredictably from one interval to another, and this variability reflects
variable driver behavior and is inherent in the problem. This property forces us
to adopt a probabilistic point of view, and probability theory provides a
powerful tool for analyzing problems of this type.
It is safe to say that uncertainty and variability are present in our modeling of
all real phenomena, and it is only natural to see that probabilistic modeling and
analysis occupy a central place in the study of a wide variety of topics in science
and engineering. There is no doubt that we will see an increasing reliance on the
use of probabilistic formulations in most scientific disciplines in the future.

2.1 ELEMENTS OF SET THEORY
Our interest in the study of a random phenomenon is in the statements we can
make concerning the events that can occur. Events and combinations of events
thus play a central role in probability theory. The mathematics of events is
closely tied to the theory of sets, and we give in this section some of its basic
concepts and algebraic operations.
A set is a collection of objects possessing some common properties. These
objects are called elements of the set and they can be of any kind with any
specified properties. We may consider, for example, a set of numbers, a set of
mathematical functions, a set of persons, or a set of a mixture of things. Capital
letters , , , , , . . . shall be used to denote sets, and lower-case letters
, , , , . . . to denote their elements. A set is thus described by its elements.
Notationally, we can write, for example,
which means that set has as its elements integers 1 through 6. If set contains
two elements, success and failure, it can be described by
where and are chosen to represent success and failure, respectively. For a set
consisting of all nonnegative real numbers, a convenient description is
We shall use the convention
to mean ‘element belongs to set ’.
A set containing no elements is called an empty or null set and is denoted by .
We distinguish between sets containing a finite number of elements and those
having an infinite number. They are called, respectively, finite sets and infinite
sets. An infinite set is called enumerable or countable if all of its elements can be
arranged in such a way that there is a one-to-one correspondence between them
and all positive integers; thus, a set containing all positive integers 1, 2, . . . is a
simple example of an enumerable set. A nonenumerable or uncountable set is one
where the above-mentioned one-to-one correspondence cannot be established. A
simple example of a nonenumerable set is the set C described above.
If every element of a set A is also an element of a set B, the set A is called
a subset of B and this is represented symbolically by

and A is the shaded area. We note here that the following relations clearly hold:

Introduction
At present, almost all undergraduate curricula in engineering and applied
sciences contain at least one basic course in probability and statistical inference.
The recognition of this need for introducing the ideas of probability theory in
a wide variety of scientific fields today reflects in part some of the profound
changes in science and engineering education over the past 25 years.
One of the most significant is the greater emphasis that has been placed upon
complexity and precision. A scientist now recognizes the importance of studying
scientific phenomena having complex interrelations among their components;
these components are often not only mechanical or electrical parts but
also ‘soft-science’ in nature, such as those stemming from behavioral and social
sciences. The design of a comprehensive transportation system, for example,
requires a good understanding of technological aspects of the problem as well
as of the behavior patterns of the user, land-use regulations, environmental
requirements, pricing policies, and so on.
Moreover, precision is stressed – precision in describing interrelationships
among factors involved in a scientific phenomenon and precision in predicting
its behavior. This, coupled with increasing complexity in the problems we face,
leads to the recognition that a great deal of uncertainty and variability are
inevitably present in problem formulation, and one of the mathematical tools
that is effective in dealing with them is probability and statistics.
Probabilistic ideas are used in a wide variety of scientific investigations
involving randomness. Randomness is an empirical phenomenon characterized
by the property that the quantities in which we are interested do not have
a predictable outcome under a given set of circumstances, but instead there is
a statistical regularity associated with different possible outcomes. Loosely
speaking, statistical regularity means that, in observing outcomes of an experiment
a large number of times (say n), the ratio m/n, where m is the number of
observed occurrences of a specific outcome, tends to a unique limit as n
becomes large. For example, the outcome of flipping a coin is not predictable
but there is statistical regularity in that the ratio m/n approaches 1
2 for either

heads or tails. Random phenomena in scientific areas abound: noise in radio
signals, intensity of wind gusts, mechanical vibration due to atmospheric disturbances,
Brownian motion of particles in a liquid, number of telephone calls
made by a given population, length of queues at a ticket counter, choice of
transportation modes by a group of individuals, and countless others. It is not
inaccurate to say that randomness is present in any realistic conceptual model
of a real-world phenomenon.
1.1 ORGANIZATION OF TEXT
This book is concerned with the development of basic principles in constructing
probability models and the subsequent analysis of these models. As in other
scientific modeling procedures, the basic cycle of this undertaking consists of
a number of fundamental steps; these are schematically presented in Figure 1.1.
A basic understanding of probability theory and random variables is central to
the whole modeling process as they provide the required mathematical machinery
with which the modeling process is carried out and consequences deduced.
The step from B to C in Figure 1.1 is the induction step by which the structure
of the model is formed from factual observations of the scientific phenomenon
under study. Model verification and parameter estimation (E) on the basis of
observed data (D) fall within the framework of statistical inference. A model

may be rejected at this stage as a result of inadequate inductive reasoning or
insufficient or deficient data. A reexamination of factual observations or additional
data may be required here. Finally, model analysis and deduction are
made to yield desired answers upon model substantiation.
In line with this outline of the basic steps, the book is divided into two parts.
Part A (Chapters 2–7) addresses probability fundamentals involved in steps
A ! C, B ! C, and E ! F (Figure 1.1). Chapters 2–5 provide these fundamentals,
which constitute the foundation of all subsequent development. Some
important probability distributions are introduced in Chapters 6 and 7. The
nature and applications of these distributions are discussed. An understanding
of the situations in which these distributions arise enables us to choose an
appropriate distribution, or model, for a scientific phenomenon.
Part B (Chapters 8–11) is concerned principally with step D ! E (Figure 1.1),
the statistical inference portion of the text. Starting with data and data representation
in Chapter 8, parameter estimation techniques are carefully developed
in Chapter 9, followed by a detailed discussion in Chapter 10 of a number of
selected statistical tests that are useful for the purpose of model verification. In
Chapter 11, the tools developed in Chapters 9 and 10 for parameter estimation
and model verification are applied to the study of linear regression models, a very
useful class of models encountered in science and engineering.
The topics covered in Part B are somewhat selective, but much of the
foundation in statistical inference is laid. This foundation should help the
reader to pursue further studies in related and more advanced areas.
1.2 PROBABILITY TABLES AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE
The application of the materials in this book to practical problems will require
calculations of various probabilities and statistical functions, which can be time
consuming. To facilitate these calculations, some of the probability tables are
provided in Appendix A. It should be pointed out, however, that a large
number of computer software packages and spreadsheets are now available
that provide this information as well as perform a host of other statistical
calculations. As an example, some statistical functions available in Microsoft
ExcelTM 2000 are listed in Appendix B.
1.3 PREREQUISITES
The material presented in this book is calculus-based. The mathematical prerequisite
for a course using this book is a good understanding of differential
and integral calculus, including partial differentiation and multidimensional
integrals. Familiarity in linear algebra, vectors, and matrices is also required.

Basic Probability Concepts
The mathematical theory of probability gives us the basic tools for constructing
and analyzing mathematical models for random phenomena. In studying a
random phenomenon, we are dealing with an experiment of which the outcome
is not predictable in advance. Experiments of this type that immediately come
to mind are those arising in games of chance. In fact, the earliest development
of probability theory in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was motivated by
problems of this type (for example, see Todhunter, 1949).
In science and engineering, random phenomena describe a wide variety of
situations. By and large, they can be grouped into two broad classes. The first
class deals with physical or natural phenomena involving uncertainties. Uncertainty
enters into problem formulation through complexity, through our lack
of understanding of all the causes and effects, and through lack of information.
Consider, for example, weather prediction. Information obtained from satellite
tracking and other meteorological information simply is not sufficient to permit
a reliable prediction of what weather condition will prevail in days ahead. It is
therefore easily understandable that weather reports on radio and television are
made in probabilistic terms.
The second class of problems widely studied by means of probabilistic
models concerns those exhibiting variability. Consider, for example, a problem
in traffic flow where an engineer wishes to know the number of vehicles crossing
a certain point on a road within a specified interval of time. This number
varies unpredictably from one interval to another, and this variability reflects
variable driver behavior and is inherent in the problem. This property forces us
to adopt a probabilistic point of view, and probability theory provides a
powerful tool for analyzing problems of this type.
It is safe to say that uncertainty and variability are present in our modeling of
all real phenomena, and it is only natural to see that probabilistic modeling and
analysis occupy a central place in the study of a wide variety of topics in science
and engineering. There is no doubt that we will see an increasing reliance on the
use of probabilistic formulations in most scientific disciplines in the future.

2.1 ELEMENTS OF SET THEORY
Our interest in the study of a random phenomenon is in the statements we can
make concerning the events that can occur. Events and combinations of events
thus play a central role in probability theory. The mathematics of events is
closely tied to the theory of sets, and we give in this section some of its basic
concepts and algebraic operations.
A set is a collection of objects possessing some common properties. These
objects are called elements of the set and they can be of any kind with any
specified properties. We may consider, for example, a set of numbers, a set of
mathematical functions, a set of persons, or a set of a mixture of things. Capital
letters , , , , , . . . shall be used to denote sets, and lower-case letters
, , , , . . . to denote their elements. A set is thus described by its elements.
Notationally, we can write, for example,
which means that set has as its elements integers 1 through 6. If set contains
two elements, success and failure, it can be described by
where and are chosen to represent success and failure, respectively. For a set
consisting of all nonnegative real numbers, a convenient description is
We shall use the convention
to mean ‘element belongs to set ’.
A set containing no elements is called an empty or null set and is denoted by .
We distinguish between sets containing a finite number of elements and those
having an infinite number. They are called, respectively, finite sets and infinite
sets. An infinite set is called enumerable or countable if all of its elements can be
arranged in such a way that there is a one-to-one correspondence between them
and all positive integers; thus, a set containing all positive integers 1, 2, . . . is a
simple example of an enumerable set. A nonenumerable or uncountable set is one
where the above-mentioned one-to-one correspondence cannot be established. A
simple example of a nonenumerable set is the set C described above.
If every element of a set A is also an element of a set B, the set A is called
a subset of B and this is represented symbolically by

and A is the shaded area. We note here that the following relations clearly hold:

of calculus is a prerequisite for the material.
The development of this book was guided by a number of considerations
observed over many years of teaching courses in this subject area, including the
following: .As an introductory course, a sound and rigorous treatment of the basic

pursue advanced work in this area in one or more of the many possible

Introduction
At present, almost all undergraduate curricula in engineering and applied
sciences contain at least one basic course in probability and statistical inference.
The recognition of this need for introducing the ideas of probability theory in
a wide variety of scientific fields today reflects in part some of the profound
changes in science and engineering education over the past 25 years.
One of the most significant is the greater emphasis that has been placed upon
complexity and precision. A scientist now recognizes the importance of studying
scientific phenomena having complex interrelations among their components;
these components are often not only mechanical or electrical parts but
also ‘soft-science’ in nature, such as those stemming from behavioral and social
sciences. The design of a comprehensive transportation system, for example,
requires a good understanding of technological aspects of the problem as well
as of the behavior patterns of the user, land-use regulations, environmental
requirements, pricing policies, and so on.
Moreover, precision is stressed – precision in describing interrelationships
among factors involved in a scientific phenomenon and precision in predicting
its behavior. This, coupled with increasing complexity in the problems we face,
leads to the recognition that a great deal of uncertainty and variability are
inevitably present in problem formulation, and one of the mathematical tools
that is effective in dealing with them is probability and statistics.
Probabilistic ideas are used in a wide variety of scientific investigations
involving randomness. Randomness is an empirical phenomenon characterized
by the property that the quantities in which we are interested do not have
a predictable outcome under a given set of circumstances, but instead there is
a statistical regularity associated with different possible outcomes. Loosely
speaking, statistical regularity means that, in observing outcomes of an experiment
a large number of times (say n), the ratio m/n, where m is the number of
observed occurrences of a specific outcome, tends to a unique limit as n
becomes large. For example, the outcome of flipping a coin is not predictable
but there is statistical regularity in that the ratio m/n approaches 1
2 for either

heads or tails. Random phenomena in scientific areas abound: noise in radio
signals, intensity of wind gusts, mechanical vibration due to atmospheric disturbances,
Brownian motion of particles in a liquid, number of telephone calls
made by a given population, length of queues at a ticket counter, choice of
transportation modes by a group of individuals, and countless others. It is not
inaccurate to say that randomness is present in any realistic conceptual model
of a real-world phenomenon.
1.1 ORGANIZATION OF TEXT
This book is concerned with the development of basic principles in constructing
probability models and the subsequent analysis of these models. As in other
scientific modeling procedures, the basic cycle of this undertaking consists of
a number of fundamental steps; these are schematically presented in Figure 1.1.
A basic understanding of probability theory and random variables is central to
the whole modeling process as they provide the required mathematical machinery
with which the modeling process is carried out and consequences deduced.
The step from B to C in Figure 1.1 is the induction step by which the structure
of the model is formed from factual observations of the scientific phenomenon
under study. Model verification and parameter estimation (E) on the basis of
observed data (D) fall within the framework of statistical inference. A model

may be rejected at this stage as a result of inadequate inductive reasoning or
insufficient or deficient data. A reexamination of factual observations or additional
data may be required here. Finally, model analysis and deduction are
made to yield desired answers upon model substantiation.
In line with this outline of the basic steps, the book is divided into two parts.
Part A (Chapters 2–7) addresses probability fundamentals involved in steps
A ! C, B ! C, and E ! F (Figure 1.1). Chapters 2–5 provide these fundamentals,
which constitute the foundation of all subsequent development. Some
important probability distributions are introduced in Chapters 6 and 7. The
nature and applications of these distributions are discussed. An understanding
of the situations in which these distributions arise enables us to choose an
appropriate distribution, or model, for a scientific phenomenon.
Part B (Chapters 8–11) is concerned principally with step D ! E (Figure 1.1),
the statistical inference portion of the text. Starting with data and data representation
in Chapter 8, parameter estimation techniques are carefully developed
in Chapter 9, followed by a detailed discussion in Chapter 10 of a number of
selected statistical tests that are useful for the purpose of model verification. In
Chapter 11, the tools developed in Chapters 9 and 10 for parameter estimation
and model verification are applied to the study of linear regression models, a very
useful class of models encountered in science and engineering.
The topics covered in Part B are somewhat selective, but much of the
foundation in statistical inference is laid. This foundation should help the
reader to pursue further studies in related and more advanced areas.
1.2 PROBABILITY TABLES AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE
The application of the materials in this book to practical problems will require
calculations of various probabilities and statistical functions, which can be time
consuming. To facilitate these calculations, some of the probability tables are
provided in Appendix A. It should be pointed out, however, that a large
number of computer software packages and spreadsheets are now available
that provide this information as well as perform a host of other statistical
calculations. As an example, some statistical functions available in Microsoft
ExcelTM 2000 are listed in Appendix B.
1.3 PREREQUISITES
The material presented in this book is calculus-based. The mathematical prerequisite
for a course using this book is a good understanding of differential
and integral calculus, including partial differentiation and multidimensional
integrals. Familiarity in linear algebra, vectors, and matrices is also required.

Basic Probability Concepts
The mathematical theory of probability gives us the basic tools for constructing
and analyzing mathematical models for random phenomena. In studying a
random phenomenon, we are dealing with an experiment of which the outcome
is not predictable in advance. Experiments of this type that immediately come
to mind are those arising in games of chance. In fact, the earliest development
of probability theory in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was motivated by
problems of this type (for example, see Todhunter, 1949).
In science and engineering, random phenomena describe a wide variety of
situations. By and large, they can be grouped into two broad classes. The first
class deals with physical or natural phenomena involving uncertainties. Uncertainty
enters into problem formulation through complexity, through our lack
of understanding of all the causes and effects, and through lack of information.
Consider, for example, weather prediction. Information obtained from satellite
tracking and other meteorological information simply is not sufficient to permit
a reliable prediction of what weather condition will prevail in days ahead. It is
therefore easily understandable that weather reports on radio and television are
made in probabilistic terms.
The second class of problems widely studied by means of probabilistic
models concerns those exhibiting variability. Consider, for example, a problem
in traffic flow where an engineer wishes to know the number of vehicles crossing
a certain point on a road within a specified interval of time. This number
varies unpredictably from one interval to another, and this variability reflects
variable driver behavior and is inherent in the problem. This property forces us
to adopt a probabilistic point of view, and probability theory provides a
powerful tool for analyzing problems of this type.
It is safe to say that uncertainty and variability are present in our modeling of
all real phenomena, and it is only natural to see that probabilistic modeling and
analysis occupy a central place in the study of a wide variety of topics in science
and engineering. There is no doubt that we will see an increasing reliance on the
use of probabilistic formulations in most scientific disciplines in the future.

2.1 ELEMENTS OF SET THEORY
Our interest in the study of a random phenomenon is in the statements we can
make concerning the events that can occur. Events and combinations of events
thus play a central role in probability theory. The mathematics of events is
closely tied to the theory of sets, and we give in this section some of its basic
concepts and algebraic operations.
A set is a collection of objects possessing some common properties. These
objects are called elements of the set and they can be of any kind with any
specified properties. We may consider, for example, a set of numbers, a set of
mathematical functions, a set of persons, or a set of a mixture of things. Capital
letters , , , , , . . . shall be used to denote sets, and lower-case letters
, , , , . . . to denote their elements. A set is thus described by its elements.
Notationally, we can write, for example,
which means that set has as its elements integers 1 through 6. If set contains
two elements, success and failure, it can be described by
where and are chosen to represent success and failure, respectively. For a set
consisting of all nonnegative real numbers, a convenient description is
We shall use the convention
to mean ‘element belongs to set ’.
A set containing no elements is called an empty or null set and is denoted by .
We distinguish between sets containing a finite number of elements and those
having an infinite number. They are called, respectively, finite sets and infinite
sets. An infinite set is called enumerable or countable if all of its elements can be
arranged in such a way that there is a one-to-one correspondence between them
and all positive integers; thus, a set containing all positive integers 1, 2, . . . is a
simple example of an enumerable set. A nonenumerable or uncountable set is one
where the above-mentioned one-to-one correspondence cannot be established. A
simple example of a nonenumerable set is the set C described above.
If every element of a set A is also an element of a set B, the set A is called
a subset of B and this is represented symbolically by

and A is the shaded area. We note here that the following relations clearly hold:

Preface
This book was written for an introductory one-semester or two-quarter course
in probability and statistics for students in engineering and applied sciences. No
previous knowledge of probability or statistics is presumed but a good understanding
of calculus is a prerequisite for the material.
The development of this book was guided by a number of considerations
observed over many years of teaching courses in this subject area, including the
following: .As an introductory course, a sound and rigorous treatment of the basic
principles is imperative for a proper understanding of the subject matter
and for confidence in applying these principles to practical problem solving.
A student, depending upon his or her major field of study, will no doubt
pursue advanced work in this area in one or more of the many possible
directions. How well is he or she prepared to do this strongly depends on
his or . her mastery of the fundamentals. It is important that the student develop an early appreciation for applications.
Demonstrations of the utility of this material in nonsuperficial applications
not only sustain student interest but also provide the student with
.stimulation to delve more deeply into the fundamentals. Most of the students in engineering and applied sciences can only devote one
semester or two quarters to a course of this nature in their programs.
Recognizing that the coverage is time limited, it is important that the material
be self-contained, representing a reasonably complete and applicable body of
knowledge.
The choice of the contents for this book is in line with the foregoing
observations. The major objective is to give a careful presentation of the
fundamentals in probability and statistics, the concept of probabilistic modeling,
and the process of model selection, verification, and analysis. In this text,
definitions and theorems are carefully stated and topics rigorously treated
but care is taken not to become entangled in excessive mathematical details.

Introduction
At present, almost all undergraduate curricula in engineering and applied
sciences contain at least one basic course in probability and statistical inference.
The recognition of this need for introducing the ideas of probability theory in
a wide variety of scientific fields today reflects in part some of the profound
changes in science and engineering education over the past 25 years.
One of the most significant is the greater emphasis that has been placed upon
complexity and precision. A scientist now recognizes the importance of studying
scientific phenomena having complex interrelations among their components;
these components are often not only mechanical or electrical parts but
also ‘soft-science’ in nature, such as those stemming from behavioral and social
sciences. The design of a comprehensive transportation system, for example,
requires a good understanding of technological aspects of the problem as well
as of the behavior patterns of the user, land-use regulations, environmental
requirements, pricing policies, and so on.
Moreover, precision is stressed – precision in describing interrelationships
among factors involved in a scientific phenomenon and precision in predicting
its behavior. This, coupled with increasing complexity in the problems we face,
leads to the recognition that a great deal of uncertainty and variability are
inevitably present in problem formulation, and one of the mathematical tools
that is effective in dealing with them is probability and statistics.
Probabilistic ideas are used in a wide variety of scientific investigations
involving randomness. Randomness is an empirical phenomenon characterized
by the property that the quantities in which we are interested do not have
a predictable outcome under a given set of circumstances, but instead there is
a statistical regularity associated with different possible outcomes. Loosely
speaking, statistical regularity means that, in observing outcomes of an experiment
a large number of times (say n), the ratio m/n, where m is the number of
observed occurrences of a specific outcome, tends to a unique limit as n
becomes large. For example, the outcome of flipping a coin is not predictable
but there is statistical regularity in that the ratio m/n approaches 1
2 for either

heads or tails. Random phenomena in scientific areas abound: noise in radio
signals, intensity of wind gusts, mechanical vibration due to atmospheric disturbances,
Brownian motion of particles in a liquid, number of telephone calls
made by a given population, length of queues at a ticket counter, choice of
transportation modes by a group of individuals, and countless others. It is not
inaccurate to say that randomness is present in any realistic conceptual model
of a real-world phenomenon.
1.1 ORGANIZATION OF TEXT
This book is concerned with the development of basic principles in constructing
probability models and the subsequent analysis of these models. As in other
scientific modeling procedures, the basic cycle of this undertaking consists of
a number of fundamental steps; these are schematically presented in Figure 1.1.
A basic understanding of probability theory and random variables is central to
the whole modeling process as they provide the required mathematical machinery
with which the modeling process is carried out and consequences deduced.
The step from B to C in Figure 1.1 is the induction step by which the structure
of the model is formed from factual observations of the scientific phenomenon
under study. Model verification and parameter estimation (E) on the basis of
observed data (D) fall within the framework of statistical inference. A model

may be rejected at this stage as a result of inadequate inductive reasoning or
insufficient or deficient data. A reexamination of factual observations or additional
data may be required here. Finally, model analysis and deduction are
made to yield desired answers upon model substantiation.
In line with this outline of the basic steps, the book is divided into two parts.
Part A (Chapters 2–7) addresses probability fundamentals involved in steps
A ! C, B ! C, and E ! F (Figure 1.1). Chapters 2–5 provide these fundamentals,
which constitute the foundation of all subsequent development. Some
important probability distributions are introduced in Chapters 6 and 7. The
nature and applications of these distributions are discussed. An understanding
of the situations in which these distributions arise enables us to choose an
appropriate distribution, or model, for a scientific phenomenon.
Part B (Chapters 8–11) is concerned principally with step D ! E (Figure 1.1),
the statistical inference portion of the text. Starting with data and data representation
in Chapter 8, parameter estimation techniques are carefully developed
in Chapter 9, followed by a detailed discussion in Chapter 10 of a number of
selected statistical tests that are useful for the purpose of model verification. In
Chapter 11, the tools developed in Chapters 9 and 10 for parameter estimation
and model verification are applied to the study of linear regression models, a very
useful class of models encountered in science and engineering.
The topics covered in Part B are somewhat selective, but much of the
foundation in statistical inference is laid. This foundation should help the
reader to pursue further studies in related and more advanced areas.
1.2 PROBABILITY TABLES AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE
The application of the materials in this book to practical problems will require
calculations of various probabilities and statistical functions, which can be time
consuming. To facilitate these calculations, some of the probability tables are
provided in Appendix A. It should be pointed out, however, that a large
number of computer software packages and spreadsheets are now available
that provide this information as well as perform a host of other statistical
calculations. As an example, some statistical functions available in Microsoft
ExcelTM 2000 are listed in Appendix B.
1.3 PREREQUISITES
The material presented in this book is calculus-based. The mathematical prerequisite
for a course using this book is a good understanding of differential
and integral calculus, including partial differentiation and multidimensional
integrals. Familiarity in linear algebra, vectors, and matrices is also required.

Basic Probability Concepts
The mathematical theory of probability gives us the basic tools for constructing
and analyzing mathematical models for random phenomena. In studying a
random phenomenon, we are dealing with an experiment of which the outcome
is not predictable in advance. Experiments of this type that immediately come
to mind are those arising in games of chance. In fact, the earliest development
of probability theory in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was motivated by
problems of this type (for example, see Todhunter, 1949).
In science and engineering, random phenomena describe a wide variety of
situations. By and large, they can be grouped into two broad classes. The first
class deals with physical or natural phenomena involving uncertainties. Uncertainty
enters into problem formulation through complexity, through our lack
of understanding of all the causes and effects, and through lack of information.
Consider, for example, weather prediction. Information obtained from satellite
tracking and other meteorological information simply is not sufficient to permit
a reliable prediction of what weather condition will prevail in days ahead. It is
therefore easily understandable that weather reports on radio and television are
made in probabilistic terms.
The second class of problems widely studied by means of probabilistic
models concerns those exhibiting variability. Consider, for example, a problem
in traffic flow where an engineer wishes to know the number of vehicles crossing
a certain point on a road within a specified interval of time. This number
varies unpredictably from one interval to another, and this variability reflects
variable driver behavior and is inherent in the problem. This property forces us
to adopt a probabilistic point of view, and probability theory provides a
powerful tool for analyzing problems of this type.
It is safe to say that uncertainty and variability are present in our modeling of
all real phenomena, and it is only natural to see that probabilistic modeling and
analysis occupy a central place in the study of a wide variety of topics in science
and engineering. There is no doubt that we will see an increasing reliance on the
use of probabilistic formulations in most scientific disciplines in the future.

2.1 ELEMENTS OF SET THEORY
Our interest in the study of a random phenomenon is in the statements we can
make concerning the events that can occur. Events and combinations of events
thus play a central role in probability theory. The mathematics of events is
closely tied to the theory of sets, and we give in this section some of its basic
concepts and algebraic operations.
A set is a collection of objects possessing some common properties. These
objects are called elements of the set and they can be of any kind with any
specified properties. We may consider, for example, a set of numbers, a set of
mathematical functions, a set of persons, or a set of a mixture of things. Capital
letters , , , , , . . . shall be used to denote sets, and lower-case letters
, , , , . . . to denote their elements. A set is thus described by its elements.
Notationally, we can write, for example,
which means that set has as its elements integers 1 through 6. If set contains
two elements, success and failure, it can be described by
where and are chosen to represent success and failure, respectively. For a set
consisting of all nonnegative real numbers, a convenient description is
We shall use the convention
to mean ‘element belongs to set ’.
A set containing no elements is called an empty or null set and is denoted by .
We distinguish between sets containing a finite number of elements and those
having an infinite number. They are called, respectively, finite sets and infinite
sets. An infinite set is called enumerable or countable if all of its elements can be
arranged in such a way that there is a one-to-one correspondence between them
and all positive integers; thus, a set containing all positive integers 1, 2, . . . is a
simple example of an enumerable set. A nonenumerable or uncountable set is one
where the above-mentioned one-to-one correspondence cannot be established. A
simple example of a nonenumerable set is the set C described above.
If every element of a set A is also an element of a set B, the set A is called
a subset of B and this is represented symbolically by

space and is denoted by the symbol S.
Consider a subset A in S. The set of all elements in S that are not elements of
A is called the complement of A, and we denote it by A. A Venn diagram
showing A and A is given in Figure 2.2 in which space S is shown as a rectangle
and A is the shaded area. We note here that the following relations clearly hold:

Preface
This book was written for an introductory one-semester or two-quarter course
in probability and statistics for students in engineering and applied sciences. No
previous knowledge of probability or statistics is presumed but a good understanding
of calculus is a prerequisite for the material.
The development of this book was guided by a number of considerations
observed over many years of teaching courses in this subject area, including the
following: .As an introductory course, a sound and rigorous treatment of the basic
principles is imperative for a proper understanding of the subject matter
and for confidence in applying these principles to practical problem solving.
A student, depending upon his or her major field of study, will no doubt
pursue advanced work in this area in one or more of the many possible
directions. How well is he or she prepared to do this strongly depends on
his or . her mastery of the fundamentals. It is important that the student develop an early appreciation for applications.
Demonstrations of the utility of this material in nonsuperficial applications
not only sustain student interest but also provide the student with
.stimulation to delve more deeply into the fundamentals. Most of the students in engineering and applied sciences can only devote one
semester or two quarters to a course of this nature in their programs.
Recognizing that the coverage is time limited, it is important that the material
be self-contained, representing a reasonably complete and applicable body of
knowledge.
The choice of the contents for this book is in line with the foregoing
observations. The major objective is to give a careful presentation of the
fundamentals in probability and statistics, the concept of probabilistic modeling,
and the process of model selection, verification, and analysis. In this text,
definitions and theorems are carefully stated and topics rigorously treated
but care is taken not to become entangled in excessive mathematical details.
TLFeBOOK
Practical examples are emphasized; they are purposely selected from many
different fields and not slanted toward any particular applied area. The same
objective is observed in making up the exercises at the back of each chapter.
Because of the self-imposed criterion of writing a comprehensive text and
presenting it within a limited time frame, there is a tight continuity from one
topic to the next. Some flexibility exists in Chapters 6 and 7 that include
discussions on more specialized distributions used in practice. For example,
extreme-value distributions may be bypassed, if it is deemed necessary, without
serious loss of continuity. Also, Chapter 11 on linear models may be deferred to
a follow-up course if time does not allow its full coverage.
It is a pleasure to acknowledge the substantial help I received from students
in my courses over many years and from my colleagues and friends. Their
constructive comments on preliminary versions of this book led to many
improvements. My sincere thanks go to Mrs. Carmella Gosden, who efficiently

a wide variety of scientific fields today reflects in part some of the profound
changes in science and engineering education over the past 25 years.
One of the most significant is the greater emphasis that has been placed upon
complexity and precision. A scientist now recognizes the importance of studying
scientific phenomena having complex interrelations among their components;
these components are often not only mechanical or electrical parts but
also ‘soft-science’ in nature, such as those stemming from behavioral and social
sciences. The design of a comprehensive transportation system, for example,
requires a good understanding of technological aspects of the problem as well
as of the behavior patterns of the user, land-use regulations, environmental
requirements, pricing policies, and so on.
Moreover, precision is stressed – precision in describing interrelationships
among factors involved in a scientific phenomenon and precision in predicting
its behavior. This, coupled with increasing complexity in the problems we face,
leads to the recognition that a great deal of uncertainty and variability are
inevitably present in problem formulation, and one of the mathematical tools
that is effective in dealing with them is probability and statistics.
Probabilistic ideas are used in a wide variety of scientific investigations
involving randomness. Randomness is an empirical phenomenon characterized
by the property that the quantities in which we are interested do not have
a predictable outcome under a given set of circumstances, but instead there is
a statistical regularity associated with different possible outcomes. Loosely
speaking, statistical regularity means that, in observing outcomes of an experiment
a large number of times (say n), the ratio m/n, where m is the number of
observed occurrences of a specific outcome, tends to a unique limit as n
becomes large. For example, the outcome of flipping a coin is not predictable
but there is statistical regularity in that the ratio m/n approaches 1

Brownian motion of particles in a liquid, number of telephone calls
made by a given population, length of queues at a ticket counter, choice of

1.1 ORGANIZATION OF TEXT
This book is concerned with the development of basic principles in constructing
probability models and the subsequent analysis of these models. As in other
scientific modeling procedures, the basic cycle of this undertaking consists of
a number of fundamental steps; these are schematically presented in Figure 1.1.
A basic understanding of probability theory and random variables is central to
the whole modeling process as they provide the required mathematical machinery
with which the modeling process is carried out and consequences deduced.
The step from B to C in Figure 1.1 is the induction step by which the structure
of the model is formed from factual observations of the scientific phenomenon
under study. Model verification and parameter estimation (E) on the basis of
observed data (D) fall within the framework of statistical inference. A model

may be rejected at this stage as a result of inadequate inductive reasoning or
insufficient or deficient data. A reexamination of factual observations or additional
data may be required here. Finally, model analysis and deduction are
made to yield desired answers upon model substantiation.
In line with this outline of the basic steps, the book is divided into two parts.
Part A (Chapters 2–7) addresses probability fundamentals involved in steps
A ! C, B ! C, and E ! F (Figure 1.1). Chapters 2–5 provide these fundamentals,
which constitute the foundation of all subsequent development. Some
important probability distributions are introduced in Chapters 6 and 7. The
nature and applications of these distributions are discussed. An understanding
of the situations in which these distributions arise enables us to choose an
appropriate distribution, or model, for a scientific phenomenon.
Part B (Chapters 8–11) is concerned principally with step D ! E (Figure 1.1),
the statistical inference portion of the text. Starting with data and data representation
in Chapter 8, parameter estimation techniques are carefully developed
in Chapter 9, followed by a detailed discussion in Chapter 10 of a number of
selected statistical tests that are useful for the purpose of model verification. In
Chapter 11, the tools developed in Chapters 9 and 10 for parameter estimation
and model verification are applied to the study of linear regression models, a very
useful class of models encountered in science and engineering.
The topics covered in Part B are somewhat selective, but much of the
foundation in statistical inference is laid. This foundation should help the
reader to pursue further studies in related and more advanced areas.
1.2 PROBABILITY TABLES AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE
The application of the materials in this book to practical problems will require
calculations of various probabilities and statistical functions, which can be time
consuming. To facilitate these calculations, some of the probability tables are
provided in Appendix A. It should be pointed out, however, that a large
number of computer software packages and spreadsheets are now available
that provide this information as well as perform a host of other statistical
calculations. As an example, some statistical functions available in Microsoft
ExcelTM 2000 are listed in Appendix B.
1.3 PREREQUISITES
The material presented in this book is calculus-based. The mathematical prerequisite
for a course using this book is a good understanding of differential
and integral calculus, including partial differentiation and multidimensional
integrals. Familiarity in linear algebra, vectors, and matrices is also required.

Basic Probability Concepts
The mathematical theory of probability gives us the basic tools for constructing
and analyzing mathematical models for random phenomena. In studying a
random phenomenon, we are dealing with an experiment of which the outcome
is not predictable in advance. Experiments of this type that immediately come
to mind are those arising in games of chance. In fact, the earliest development
of probability theory in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was motivated by
problems of this type (for example, see Todhunter, 1949).
In science and engineering, random phenomena describe a wide variety of
situations. By and large, they can be grouped into two broad classes. The first
class deals with physical or natural phenomena involving uncertainties. Uncertainty
enters into problem formulation through complexity, through our lack
of understanding of all the causes and effects, and through lack of information.
Consider, for example, weather prediction. Information obtained from satellite
tracking and other meteorological information simply is not sufficient to permit
a reliable prediction of what weather condition will prevail in days ahead. It is
therefore easily understandable that weather reports on radio and television are
made in probabilistic terms.
The second class of problems widely studied by means of probabilistic
models concerns those exhibiting variability. Consider, for example, a problem
in traffic flow where an engineer wishes to know the number of vehicles crossing
a certain point on a road within a specified interval of time. This number
varies unpredictably from one interval to another, and this variability reflects
variable driver behavior and is inherent in the problem. This property forces us
to adopt a probabilistic point of view, and probability theory provides a
powerful tool for analyzing problems of this type.
It is safe to say that uncertainty and variability are present in our modeling of
all real phenomena, and it is only natural to see that probabilistic modeling and
analysis occupy a central place in the study of a wide variety of topics in science
and engineering. There is no doubt that we will see an increasing reliance on the
use of probabilistic formulations in most scientific disciplines in the future.

2.1 ELEMENTS OF SET THEORY
Our interest in the study of a random phenomenon is in the statements we can
make concerning the events that can occur. Events and combinations of events
thus play a central role in probability theory. The mathematics of events is
closely tied to the theory of sets, and we give in this section some of its basic
concepts and algebraic operations.
A set is a collection of objects possessing some common properties. These
objects are called elements of the set and they can be of any kind with any
specified properties. We may consider, for example, a set of numbers, a set of
mathematical functions, a set of persons, or a set of a mixture of things. Capital
letters , , , , , . . . shall be used to denote sets, and lower-case letters
, , , , . . . to denote their elements. A set is thus described by its elements.
Notationally, we can write, for example,
which means that set has as its elements integers 1 through 6. If set contains
two elements, success and failure, it can be described by
where and are chosen to represent success and failure, respectively. For a set
consisting of all nonnegative real numbers, a convenient description is
We shall use the convention
to mean ‘element belongs to set ’.
A set containing no elements is called an empty or null set and is denoted by .
We distinguish between sets containing a finite number of elements and those
having an infinite number. They are called, respectively, finite sets and infinite
sets. An infinite set is called enumerable or countable if all of its elements can be
arranged in such a way that there is a one-to-one correspondence between them
and all positive integers; thus, a set containing all positive integers 1, 2, . . . is a
simple example of an enumerable set. A nonenumerable or uncountable set is one
where the above-mentioned one-to-one correspondence cannot be established. A
simple example of a nonenumerable set is the set C described above.
If every element of a set A is also an element of a set B, the set A is called
a subset of B and this is represented symbolically by

space and is denoted by the symbol S.

showing A and A is given in Figure 2.2 in which space S is shown as a rectangle
and A is the shaded area. We note here that the following relations clearly hold:

Preface
This book was written for an introductory one-semester or two-quarter course
in probability and statistics for students in engineering and applied sciences. No
previous knowledge of probability or statistics is presumed but a good understanding
of calculus is a prerequisite for the material.
The development of this book was guided by a number of considerations
observed over many years of teaching courses in this subject area, including the
following: .As an introductory course, a sound and rigorous treatment of the basic
principles is imperative for a proper understanding of the subject matter
and for confidence in applying these principles to practical problem solving.
A student, depending upon his or her major field of study, will no doubt
pursue advanced work in this area in one or more of the many possible
directions. How well is he or she prepared to do this strongly depends on
his or . her mastery of the fundamentals. It is important that the student develop an early appreciation for applications.
Demonstrations of the utility of this material in nonsuperficial applications
not only sustain student interest but also provide the student with
.stimulation to delve more deeply into the fundamentals. Most of the students in engineering and applied sciences can only devote one
semester or two quarters to a course of this nature in their programs.
Recognizing that the coverage is time limited, it is important that the material
be self-contained, representing a reasonably complete and applicable body of
knowledge.
The choice of the contents for this book is in line with the foregoing
observations. The major objective is to give a careful presentation of the
fundamentals in probability and statistics, the concept of probabilistic modeling,
and the process of model selection, verification, and analysis. In this text,
definitions and theorems are carefully stated and topics rigorously treated
but care is taken not to become entangled in excessive mathematical details.
TLFeBOOK
Practical examples are emphasized; they are purposely selected from many
different fields and not slanted toward any particular applied area. The same
objective is observed in making up the exercises at the back of each chapter.
Because of the self-imposed criterion of writing a comprehensive text and
presenting it within a limited time frame, there is a tight continuity from one
topic to the next. Some flexibility exists in Chapters 6 and 7 that include
discussions on more specialized distributions used in practice. For example,
extreme-value distributions may be bypassed, if it is deemed necessary, without
serious loss of continuity. Also, Chapter 11 on linear models may be deferred to
a follow-up course if time does not allow its full coverage.
It is a pleasure to acknowledge the substantial help I received from students
in my courses over many years and from my colleagues and friends. Their
constructive comments on preliminary versions of this book led to many
improvements. My sincere thanks go to Mrs. Carmella Gosden, who efficiently
typed several drafts of this book. As in all my undertakings, my wife, Dottie,
cared about this project and gave me her loving support for which I am deeply
grateful.
